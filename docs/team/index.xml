      <description>I am an undergraduate senior working on a computer science bachelor’s degree. Outside of school, I’m passionate about music, running, and the outdoors. My experience being both a student and teaching assistant in programming has made me appreciate the value in tools that are powerful and still easy to learn. My motivation for this project has been to be a part of creating such a tool that helps others to learn and enjoy writing code.</description>

      <description>I am 23 years old and graduating this semester with a degree in Computer Science. Some of my favorite hobbies are video games, puzzles, and running. My academic interests outside of computing include sociology, art, and world religion. My interest in this project comes from creating geographic weather interactives, and seeing how challening it was to use existing tools.</description>
