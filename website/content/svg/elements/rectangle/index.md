title: Rectangle
weight: 2

This interactive demonstrates the properties of the rectangle element. There are two controls: one that changes the (x,y) position of the rectangle, and another that changes the width and height attributes.

<!-- TODO: probably allow for negative attributes to show the most accurate behavior -->

{{<example "svg-rectangle">}}
